# UnityGAS<!-- omit in toc -->

## Introduction
GAS is short for Gameplay Ability System, the ability system architecture from Unreal ([For more information](https://github.com/tranek/GASDocumentation)).\
And this is an implementation of GAS in Unity.\
In short, GAS can help you create a complicated attribute, ability, effect system for your game with ease.\
It has been used in some projects and fully tested with Unity Test Framework but I'm still improving it so feel free to use and contribute.

## Installation
This package require my [Unity Extension Core](https://github.com/h2v9696/UnityExtensionsCore) so install it via Unity Package Manager.\
Also its depend on this Utility package so make sure to install it.\
[Unity SerializeReferenceExtensions](https://github.com/mackysoft/Unity-SerializeReferenceExtensions?tab=readme-ov-file#-installation)

After that, add git address in Unity Package Manager: https://github.com/h2v9696/UnityGAS.git\
Or you can use git to clone this repository, then copy the whole folder to your project.

## Usage
This package is basically same as GAS in Unreal Engine,\
so to understand this better you should take a look at [Unreal Engine's Document](https://github.com/tranek/GASDocumentation).\
These explanations assume you have a basic understanding of GAS and Unity's Scriptable Object (SO) structure.\
But feel free to check out my guide firstâ€”I'll try to include as many reference links as possible.
